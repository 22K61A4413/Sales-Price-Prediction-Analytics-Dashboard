⚠️ Note: If the link does not open immediately, it is likely due to Streamlit Cloud free-tier limitations:
Free apps may go to sleep if inactive for ~1 hour.
First load after inactivity may take a few seconds to start.
Concurrent user limits may temporarily restrict access.
In such cases, try refreshing the page after a few seconds.
